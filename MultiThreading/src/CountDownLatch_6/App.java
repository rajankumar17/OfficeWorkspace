/**
 * CountDownLatch works in latch principle, the main thread will wait until the gate is open.
 * One thread waits for n threads, specified while creating the CountDownLatch.
 *
 * Any thread, usually the main thread of the application, which calls CountDownLatch.await()
 * will wait until count reaches zero or it's interrupted by another thread. All other threads
 * are required to count down by calling CountDownLatch.countDown() once they are completed or ready.
 *
 * As soon as count reaches zero, the waiting thread continues. One of the disadvantages/advantages
 * of CountDownLatch is that it's not reusable: once count reaches zero you cannot use CountDownLatch any more.
 *
 * Use CountDownLatch when one thread (like the main thread) requires to wait for one or more threads to
 * complete, before it can continue processing.
 *
 * A classical example of using CountDownLatch in Java is a server side core Java application which uses
 * services architecture, where multiple services are provided by multiple threads and the application
 * cannot start processing until all services have started successfully.
